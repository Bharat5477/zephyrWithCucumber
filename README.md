This Framework will help you to update the Test Cycle Status and Steps of the Test Case which is executed in the Test Cycle.

With the help of cucumber json report it will update the status.

Usage:

	1. Each Test Case should be added as one scenario in the feature file.
	2. Our feature file Steps and Zephyr test case steps should be same.
	
Example:
